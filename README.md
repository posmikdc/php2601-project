# Assessing Student Performance

We will be analyzing student performance data. The dataset is publicly accessible from Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors?resource=download)

## Goals

We are interested in understanding the predictors of student performance as measured by exam scores. We will be approaching this question with the following methods: 

- Linear model: Ordinary least squares estimation
- Linear dimension reduction: Principal component analysis
- Non-linear model: Kernel regression
