# Example Beamer Presentation

This is an example beamer presentation with a few template slides. The highlights are: 

- Custom color theme 
- Custom formatting of footnotes, headers, slide content
- Custom citation commands to follow APA guidelines in presentations

The design philosophy of these slides follows the idea that less is better.
